All odd pins are ground.

Supercard Pro / Kryoflux:
-------------------------
Drive the bus with high-drive octal line drivers ('244/'245).
Pins 8/26-30/34 are configured as input, with 1k pull-ups.
All other pins are *push-pull* outputs (not open collector!).
Note pin 2 is a push-pull output, we must take care not to drive it to
0V from the floppy side unless we are on a host (eg Amiga) which is
expecting to receive a signal there.

PWM backlight control:
----------------------
PB10 is an active-low open-drain PWM control for the LCD backlight. It
must be a 5v-tolerant pin, as it is pulled up to 5v. It drives a PNP
transistor (e.g. BC212, BC327) through a resistor:

                 Vcc(5v)
                  |
                 / E
PB10 ---|1k|----|  B  PNP BJT (eg BC327)
                 \ C
                  |
                 ---
                 33R
                 ---
                  |
                 LED

Ib ~= 5mA; Ic = I_led ~= 50mA; V_led ~= 3.2V.

33ohm series resistor is chosen to limit LED current to 50-60mA in the
operating voltage range of 3.0-3.3V with a conservative Vce(sat).
Assuming Vce(sat)=0.1-0.2V:
V_led=3.0V -> V_r=1.8-1.9V -> I=55-58mA
V_led=3.2V -> V_r=1.6-1.7V -> I=48-52mA
V_led=3.3V -> V_r=1.5-1.6V -> I=45-48mA

Actual readings (Vcc=4.9V):
BC327-40: Vce=0.04V; V_led=3.19V; V_r=1.66V; I=48.0mA
BC212L:   Vce=0.09V; V_led=3.19V; V_r=1.59V; I=47.6mA

Driving the load with 5v rather than 3.3v means ~100mW is disippated
in the series resistor rather than a surface-mount linear
regulator. It also means -dV/dI through the LED is larger (because the
series resistor is larger), and variations in the transistor's
Vce(sat) matter less; thus we more accurately control I_led.
